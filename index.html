                    <h2>Are technical skills no longer enough?</h2>
                    <p>Have you reached a point in your career where your technical expertise isn’t
                        enough to navigate the challenges you face?</p>
                    <p>Perhaps you’re now managing a team—people with emotions, motivations, and
                        unique needs. Or maybe the stress of admin tasks, budgets, deadlines,
                        and office politics is starting to pile up. The list of non-technical
                        challenges can feel overwhelming.</p>
                    <p>If this resonates with you, coaching could provide the support you need.</p>

                    <h2>Can coaching help you?</h2>
                    <p>Coaching is a proven process designed to help individuals grow, improve their
                        performance, and overcome challenges. It provides a dedicated space for
                        you to reflect on the areas you want to work on, free from judgment or
                        interruption.</p>
                    <p>Having someone truly listen to you—someone who is there solely to help you—is
                        incredibly powerful. Through coaching, you’ll gain new perspectives,
                        increase your self-awareness, and uncover solutions or actions you may
                        not have considered.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, simply raising awareness about a problem can make it feel
                        smaller—or even make it disappear entirely.</p>

                    <h2>What to expect from a coaching session</h2>
                    <p>My coaching style is conversational and collaborative. I ask open-ended
                        questions, listen actively, and echo back to ensure I’ve understood you
                        correctly.</p>
                    <p>I often use the GROW model (Goal, Reality, Options, Will) as a framework:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Goal</strong>: What are you aiming to achieve?</li>
                        <li><strong>Reality</strong>: What’s happening now?</li>
                        <li><strong>Options</strong>: What actions could you take?</li>
                        <li><strong>Will</strong>: What will you do next?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>During our sessions, you’ll do most of the talking. My role is to help you
                        uncover solutions within yourself. The process is about empowering you
                        to take action and make meaningful progress.</p>

                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>Coaching is all about <em>you</em>, not me. However, it’s important to know
                        who you’ll be working with, so here’s a little about me:</p>
                    <p>I’m an engineer with a background in life sciences. I hold a PhD in
                        biochemistry but transitioned into software engineering after completing
                        my studies. Having worked in both academia and industry, I understand
                        the unique challenges of each environment.</p>
                    <p>As a coach, I hold a Level 5 Certificate and Diploma in <strong>Effective
                            Coaching and Mentoring</strong> from the Institute of Leadership
                        and Management.</p>
                    <p>Originally from Sweden, I’ve lived in the UK for the past 20 years, after
                        spending five years in France. I’m comfortable working with both native
                        and non-native English speakers, bringing a global perspective to my
                        practice.</p>
